## ‚úÖ Git Commands in Sequential Workflow

This table outlines a typical Git workflow with commands listed in a logical order, ensuring clarity for beginners and advanced users. Each command includes a description and the reason for its use.

| Step | Command                                            | Description                                              | Reason                                                                                          |

## üîß Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically reconcile changes from two branches. Follow these steps to resolve them:

1. Attempt the merge and encounter a conflict:

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

2. Git will notify you about conflicts in specific files.

3. Open the conflicted files and look for conflict markers:

   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   // Your current branch (e.g., main) changes
   =======
   // Changes from the feature-branch
   >>>>>>> feature-branch
   ```

4. Manually edit the file to keep the desired lines, removing the conflict markers.

   ```
   // Your current branch (e.g., main) changes
   // Changes from the feature-branch
   ```

5. Stage the resolved files:

   ```bash
   git add filename
   ```

6. Commit the resolution:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "resolve merge conflict"
   ```

7. Push the final version to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## üîç Examples for Common Operations

### 1‚Äì4. Configure Git Identity

Set your global identity to associate commits with your name and email (used by platforms like GitHub):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Tanvir Anjom Siddique"        # Sets your name for all repositories
git config --global user.email "tanvir.anjom.siddique@gmail.com"  # Sets your email for all repositories

# Override locally if needed
git config user.name "Tanvir Work"                           # Overrides name for current repo
git config user.email "work@example.com"                     # Overrides email for current repo
```

---

### 5‚Äì7. Initialize or Clone a Repository

Start a new Git repository or clone an existing one:

```bash
cd ~/projects/practiceGit          # Navigate to your project directory
git init                         # Initialize an empty Git repository
```

Alternatively, clone an existing repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanvirsweb/gitPractice.git    # Copies remote repo locally
cd gitPractice                   # Move into the cloned directory
```

---

### 8‚Äì10. Connect to a Remote Repository

Link your local repository to a remote (e.g., GitHub):

1. Visit your GitHub profile: [https://github.com/tanvirsweb](https://github.com/tanvirsweb)
2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Create a new repository named: `gitPractice`
4. Click **Create repository** (no need to initialize with README, .gitignore, or license)

Then run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/tanvirsweb/gitPractice.git  # Link remote repository
git remote -v                                                        # Verify the remote URL
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tanvirsweb/gitPractice.git  # (Optional) Switch to SSH if preferred
```
---

### 11‚Äì15. Create and Commit Files

Create files, stage, and commit them:

```bash
echo "# My Project" > README.md    # Create a README file
git add README.md                  # Stage the README file
git commit -m "Initial commit"    # Commit with a descriptive message
git branch -M main                 # Rename default branch to 'main'
git push -u origin main            # Push to remote and set upstream tracking
```

If your local project has commits but the remote has initial commits (e.g., a README or license):

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories  # Merge local and remote histories
```

### 16‚Äì17. Feature Branch Workflow

Create a new branch for isolated development:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch            # Create and switch to feature branch
echo "New feature" >> feature.txt         # Add content to a new file
git add .                                 # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Add feature"               # Commit changes
git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch  # Push branch and set tracking
```

---

### 18‚Äì22. Merge Feature Branch and Clean Up

Merge the feature branch into main and clean up:

```bash
git checkout main                         # Switch to main branch
git pull origin main                      # Ensure main is up-to-date
git merge feature-branch                  # Merge feature branch into main
git push origin main                      # Push merged changes to GitHub
git branch -d feature-branch              # Delete local feature branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch   # Delete remote feature branch
```

---

### 23‚Äì25. Amend a Commit

Fix or update the last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Updated message"  # Modify last commit
git push --force                         # Overwrite remote history (caution!)
```

---

### 26‚Äì28. Explore Commit History

Review the project‚Äôs commit history:

```bash
git fetch origin                        # Fetch latest remote metadata
git log --oneline                      # Compact commit history view
git log --merge                        # View commits causing merge conflicts (if any)
```

---

### 29‚Äì31. Work with Stashes

Temporarily save and restore uncommitted changes:

```bash
git stash                              # Save uncommitted changes
git checkout main                      # Switch branches without losing work
git stash pop                         # Reapply stashed changes
git stash list                        # List all stashed changes
git stash drop                        # Delete the most recent stash
```

---

### 32‚Äì34. Selective Staging and Discarding Changes

Stage specific files or revert changes:

```bash
git add file1.py                      # Stage a specific file
git add *.html                       # Stage all HTML files
git restore file1.py                 # Discard changes to a file (reverts to last commit)
```

---

### 35‚Äì36. Revert or Cherry-Pick Commits

Undo or reuse specific commits:

```bash
git log                               # get info of commits and hash
git revert <commit-hash>              # Create a new commit to undo a previous one
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>         # Apply a specific commit from another branch
```

---

### 37‚Äì39. Clean Up Remote and Local Branches

Remove obsolete branches:

```bash
git fetch -p                        # Prune stale remote-tracking branches
git branch -D feature-branch        # Force delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch  # Delete remote branch
```

---

### 40‚Äì41. Compare Changes

Review differences before committing or merging:

```bash
git diff                          # View all changes in working directory
git diff main feature-branch      # Compare two branches
```

---

### 42‚Äì43. Resolve Merge Conflicts (Detailed)

If a merge results in conflicts:

```bash
git merge feature-branch            # Attempt merge, triggers conflicts

# Open conflicted files, edit to remove conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

git add resolved-file.py            # Stage resolved files
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"  # Commit resolution
git push origin main                # Push changes
```
